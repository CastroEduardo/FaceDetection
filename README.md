# FaceDetection
Detecting faces in mages using Open CV and Haarcascades.

This requires Open CV, Python, Haar Cascades training data and suitable OS platform (Mac, Linux or Windows). For specific version please check vendor websites for the latest.

I used Python 2.7.14 on a test machine running Windows 7 Professional (i3 2.1 GHz Arrandale)

The OpenCV 3 was used with this project, suitable for Python 2.7.14

Images used in this project were set to a resolution of 500 x 331 pixels (JPEG)
